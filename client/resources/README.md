# Image selection

Right now the image we use as logo is

`Logo_PoliTo_dal_2021_blu.png`

This image doesn't have a backgroud (i.e. its background is transparent).

If you use in your browser a dark theme (for example, Chrome's "Just Black"), you won't be able to see the logo at all since it'll be a blue logo on a dark background.

If you think this is a problem, we can swap to

`Logo_PoliTo_dal_2021_blu_sfondo_bianco.png`

which has a white background.

In theory it's better to have a logo without a background BUT if this is a problem in a dark-themed browser we should swap.
